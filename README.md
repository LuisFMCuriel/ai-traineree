My stab at solving AI games and problems

## WIP

Currently only solving OpenAi gym `CartPole-v1`. To reproduce this amazing achievement from root run
```bash
> python -m examples.cart
```

## Running

Firstly you need to install the package. See below for instructions.

The easiest way to start exploring is through the examples. To run an example, e.g. `cart.py` execute
```bash
> python -m examples.cart
```
from the root directory, i.e. where this README.md.

## Install

### Ubuntu

Install debs via `install-ubuntu-debs.sh`, e.g.
```sh
> sudo ./install-ubuntu-debs.sh
```
