Welcome, AI Traineree!
======================

As you may have noticed, current version of the documentation is rather modest. True.
But be patient, young one, as this is only the beginning. Hopefully.

It is always a motivational boost and a driver to see that someone is using the project.
Feel free to let me know if you have any questions or anything, and I'll sure try to help.
